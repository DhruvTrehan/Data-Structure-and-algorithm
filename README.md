In this repository, I would be sharing a daily byte regarding Data Structure and Algorithm. I would be discuss the code and algorithm to learn along with the community 
# Linked List 
Linked List is a linear collection of the data elements. It is data structure consisting of collection of nodes which together represents the sequence. Each node consists of:
o	Data 
o	Reference (Address to next node) 
 
<h2>Features of Linked List</h2>

 •	Structure of Linked List allows the efficient insertion or removal of an element at any position

 •	Access time is linear in Linked List
 
 •	Random access is not feasible in Linked List 
 
 •	Arrays have better cache locality compared to Linked List 

<b>Cache Locality(Locality of Reference or Principal of Locality)</b>

Tendency of a processor to access same set of memory location repetitively over a shorter period of a time. 

<h2>Benefit of a Linked List over an array.</h2> 

The list items could be easily removed or re-inserted without any reallocation or reorganization of an entire structure because data items could not be restored contiguously. 
In the disk, while restructuring in an array is a long process. Linked List are dynamic, so the length of the list can be increased or decreased depending upon situation. However, the length of the array remains same as that at the time of deceleration and cannot be changed.
